# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository contains several projects showcasing different machine learning techniques and models. Below, you'll find descriptions of each project along with instructions on how to set them up and run them.

## Projects

### 1. Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system suggests movies to users based on their past ratings and preferences.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Collaborative filtering algorithms
- Evaluation metrics for recommendation systems

### 2. White Wine Quality Prediction
This project builds a prediction model for the quality of white wine using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset contains various chemical properties of the wine which are used as features for the model.

**Features:**
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- SVM model training and evaluation

### 3. Servo Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
This project uses simple linear regression to predict the speed of a servo motor based on input signals. The dataset consists of input-output pairs that are used to train the regression model.

**Features:**
- Data visualization and analysis
- Linear regression model training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
